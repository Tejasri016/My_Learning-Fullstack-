  <h1>The Sweetest surprise</h1>
  </center>
  <p>Once upon a rainy afternoon, little Maya stood by the window, bored and restless. Her grandma noticed and smiled.</p>
  <p>"Want to help me bake some cookies?" she asked.</p>
  <p>Maya's eyes lit up. "Chocolate chip?"
"Of course," Grandma winked.</p>
  <p>As the smell of warm cookies filled the kitchen, Maya giggled, sneaking chocolate chips when Grandma wasn’t looking. They shaped the dough, talked about school, dreams, and silly things.</p>
  <p> When the cookies were done, Maya took a bite.
“These are magical,” she said with crumbs on her lips.</p>
  <p>Grandma laughed. “It’s not just the chocolate. It’s the love we put in.”</p>
  <p>And from that day on, rainy days were no longer boring — they were cookie days.</p>
